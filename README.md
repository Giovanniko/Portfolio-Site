# Portfolio-Site
Portfolio project from Udacity's Front-end Developer Course

This was the second project of the class. It included a greater range of features available for responsive design. The main feature was art direction using srcset to make the page mobile-friendly and to keep total page size down. The page was built on a bootstrap framework to get started. It also included features such as Zocial icons, importing fonts, using vector graphics, and modal features that this text is displayed on.
